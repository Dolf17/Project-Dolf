<p> 
   <h2> ACT 1</h2>
</p>
<p>PROLOGUE</p>
Two households, both alike in dignity,
<div></div>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
<div></div>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
<div></div>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
<div></div>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
<div></div>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
<div></div>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
<div></div>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
<div></div>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
<div></div>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
<div></div>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
<div></div>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
<div></div>
The which if you with patient ears attend,
<div></div>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. 
<div></div>
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
<div></div>

Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
<div></div>
SAMPSON
<div></div>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
<div></div>
GREGORY
<div></div>
No, for then we should be colliers.
